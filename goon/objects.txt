  - name: Welder
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: A heavy engineering tool. An active welder will ignite plasma, break light bulbs, set off nearby fire alarms and do horrible things when swung at a person. Must be activated to work and has a limited supply of fuel. Has nearly as many uses as screwdrivers and crowbars, but operating one will cause eye damage without proper protection. 

  - name: Security Helmet
    tags: [clothes, armor, equip]
    info:
      notes: Provides moderate protection to the head, though you can still be rendered unconscious from repeated trauma.

  - name: Power Cell
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Main power for cyborgs and backup juice for APCs before the lights go out. Several types of these high-capacity batteries can be found on the station, differing in maximum capacity or other properties. If depleted, they may be recharged manually. 

  - name: Light Tube
    tags: [light]
    info:
      notes: In addition to windows and floor tiles, the incandescent tubes are usually the first casualties of rampant chemistry in the science wing or the cafeteria. Boxes of replacement lights are available in e.g. tool storage and the janitor's closet. They can also be fabricated in a rainbow of colors, including black light. 

  - name: Metal Sheet
    tags: []

  - name: Beaker
    tags: [container]
    info:
      notes: Holds up to 50 units of chemicals. Standard equipment for chemistry, but medbay has some as well. You generally can't examine the exact contents without spectroscopic goggles, a PDA reagent scanner or by using certain machinery.

  - name: Staple gun
    tags: [weapon, tool]
    info:
      notes: Used to reattach limbs. As with the other surgery tools, staplers are available from robotics manufacturers.

  - name: Flashlight
    tags: [light]
    info:
      notes: Illuminates dark areas. Found in emergency toolboxes and the warehouse, among other places. Small enough to fit in a pocket or on your belt. Multiple light sources on your person will stack, lighting a larger area with greater luminosity.

  - name: Gas Tank
    tags: [tank]
    info:
      notes: These large tanks hold up to 1013 kPa of gaseous elements. By default, they contain an air mixture (white), O2 (blue w/ white stripe), N2O (white w/ red stripe) or plasma (special sprite). With the exception of the latter, they can be worn on the back slot. Compatible with the connector port of air pumps, air scrubbers, tank transfer valves and gas canisters.

  - name: Fuel Tank
    tags: [container]
    info:
      notes: This small tank has been designed specifically for holding flammable compounds. As such, they contain welding fuel by default. Essential component of flamethrowers.

  - name: Flash
    tags: [weapon]
    info:
      notes: |
             The flash has two applications. Using the flash on someone without adequate eye protection will stun them and obscure their screen with a white flash.
             The other use is area flash, activated by clicking on the weapon when it's in your active hand. This will briefly obscure the screen of everyone nearby with a white overlay but not stun them. Area flashes also have a chance of disrupting active cloaking devices as well as holographic disguisers in a 3x3 radius.
             
             Every time the flash is used, the bulb has a chance of burning out, rendering it permanently useless. They can be found in security lockers, dispensed from the vending machines and are in great supply in robotics. 

  - name: Remote Signaler
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Sends out a radio signal of a given code on a set frequency, and when attached to something, will activate when it receives that signal.

  - name: Proximity Sensor
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: When armed, it will activate whenever it detects motion adjacent to it. 

  - name: Timer
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Activates once the timer hits 0.

  - name: Igniter
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: If used as an attachment, igniters heat the beaker or other assembly when activated. Can also be used to light cigarettes, or manually heat reagent containers.

  - name: Electropack
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Goes on the back slot of a monkey or other victim; it cannot be removed by the wearer. Set a remote signaler and the pack to the same frequency and code, then turn it on. When a signal is received, the pack delivers a debilitating jolt of electricity to whomever is wearing it.

  - name: Firesuit
    tags: [equip, clothes]
    info:
      notes: Protects the wearer from extreme heat/cold and from catching fire. The suit can deteriorate from prolonged exposure to extreme conditions, so don't go wading into that scorching plasma fire. The suit is also not effective against hard vacuum and will slow down your running speed when you're wearing it. Available in engineering storage.

  - name: Bedsheet 
    tags: [equip, clothes]

  - name: Mousetrap
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Sometimes used by jerks to kill the chef's only friend. You can also hide these in containers such as backpacks or emergency boxes to make traps for unsuspecting victims! For the ultimate party gag, try to combine them with certain other items...oh, the possibilities of a single mousetrap! Make sure to arm it by clicking on it in your hand before putting it down!

  - name: Fire extinguisher
    tags: [container]
    info:
      notes: Useful for firefighting, as an impromptu jetpack and the weapon of choice for seasoned greyshirts. Just remember to disable the safety first and that against any fire which is still being fueled, you won't make much progress. Once emptied, you don't necessarily have to refill it with regular foam either...

  - name: Gas canister
    tags: [tank]
    info:
       notes: Large storage containers of gas. Smaller tanks can be attached to them, to either draw or put in their contents. They can also be fixed to appropriate connector ports with a wrench.

  - name: Atmospheric analyzer
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Instant atmospheric analysis. Lists the temperature, pressure and the proportions of gases either in the open air or inside pipes and canisters. Abundantly available in blue toolboxes, but every PDA has this feature built-in.

    tags: []
    info:
     notes: Honk honk!

  - name: Station bounced radio
    tags: []
    info:

  - name: Paper
    tags: [equip, clothes]
    info:
     notes: Use a pen on it to write stuff, examine it to read. Click on a noticeboard to pin it there. Place on head slot to wear it as a hat. You can also hold paper up to a camera to discreetly send messages to the AI.

  - name: Vuvuzela
    tags: []

  - name: Health analyzer
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Scan humans or monkeys to get a report of their health, damage taken, any viruses and other ailments. Regular analyzers can be upgraded with a reagent scanner, which can be toggled on/off and only works on mobs. The medical PDA provides the same functionality with two separate programs, though its reagent scanner is more flexible and doesn't have the same restrictions.

  - name: Pen
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Used for writing on said paper, or leaving graffiti on the floor and walls. Variants include the sleepy pen traitor item and I-pen to leave infrared messages that can only be read with the help of optical meson scanners.

  - name: Stun baton
    tags: [weapon]
    info:
      notes: |
             A melee weapon which delivers an incapacitating shock to the target, knocking them to the ground. It is also effective against cyborgs.
             The stun baton has an On/Off function, and is on by default. Attempting to use it with the harm intent will instead stun YOU, leaving you at the mercy of whoever you were pursuing. A switched-off baton is completely inert unless you use the harm intent, which results in a good old beating.
             
             They hold ten charges (examine the baton to see the number of charges left) and are available in security lockers.
