  - name: Arc smelter
    info:
      notes: |
             Processes raw material into material bars suitable for manufacturers. Up to two materials can be loaded to make a combination alloy that combines the functionality of both materials (i.e. combining a metal and a crystal will have it be recognized as both metal and crystal.
             
             Note that every use of the smelter causes slag to build up inside of it which, if not removed, will decrease the quality of each successive alloy and cause smoke to billow out of the smelter until it's fixed. Remove slag by clicking the smelter with the slag shovel.
