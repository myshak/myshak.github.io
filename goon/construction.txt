             Cyborg parts are classified as light, standard, sturdy or heavy. Durability increases with heavier parts, but mobility decreases. Overweight cyborgs will also use slightly more power.
             
             For the most part, the game will prevent you from inserting unsuitable (job-banned etc.) brains automatically. If you use an AI interface board instead of a brain, the AI will be able to assume control of the cyborg body at will.
             
             Remove limbs: use the wrench on the frame, then select the appropriate cyborg part.
             Remove brain: detach the cyborg head first, then click on it with the wrench.

              Floorbots will detect nearby areas of space and tirelessly use their very finite supply of floor tiles to turn it into walkable floors. Floorbots may also be produced outright at a robotics fabricator (where they will spawn with 10 tiles) or ordered from the cargo bay.
             
              If you use more than 10 floor tiles, the finished floorbot will have however many you put in. If you use less than 10, the floorbot will have 10. Therefore, it is most efficient to use 1-2 in creation and load the rest after the floorbot is done.

             Reduces the amount of bleeding, hence repeated application might be necessary to bandage a wound completely. Bandages alone aren't sufficient for mending surgical incisions, however. Bandages can be removed with wirecutters or scissors if the patient doesn't like the cosmetic overlay on their mob.

             To add extras, use a crowbar on the south west corner of the pod and add any system. To replace an existing system (like the engine), click the pod with an empty hand while the maintenance panel is open to bring up an interface for adding and removing installed systems. 
             
             You can also change the gas mix used for the engine and the gas mix used for the pod's life support system, though this doesn't have much of a use other then to suffocate the people in the pod with plasma.

  - name: Entire rooms (ABC-U)
    info:
      notes: ABC-Us and blueprint markers can be found in the supply warehouse. You don't need to replicate entire rooms. You can pick a section of it or multiple sections to create different rooms. The blueprint marker can create multiple blueprints before running out of energy. This way you can pick all the pieces you want in advance and put them together in a new configuration. Remember to save them with their own names so you don't get them mixed.

  - name: APC (hack)
    info:
      notes: There are four wires. Two short out the APC when cut, one cuts AI control when cut, and one does nothing when cut, but unlocks the APC when pulsed with a multitool.  There's a chance you'll get shocked when cutting wires, so either have insulated gloves or do it in an isolated area where no-one will find you.  South maintenance is a good choice.
