  - name: Suicide bomb vest
    unsorted: true
    info:
      notes: |
             Despite the name, no bombs are actually involved (anymore). The payload will be triggered upon death of whoever is wearing the vest, heating the mixture inside the beaker by 30 K when so equipped.
             You can detach whatever you put on the vest with a wrench.

  - name: Pipe bomb
    unsorted: true
    info:
      notes: |
             Not to be confused with the version traitors can order. Other materials can be used in place of welding fuel if available. Ordered by explosive power - phlogiston, CLF3, black powder or NI3. 
             
             Plasmastone and erebite work differently in that they are crafted from custom metal sheets, then combined with one of the listed reagents.

              If you use more than 10 floor tiles, the finished floorbot will have however many you put in. If you use less than 10, the floorbot will have 10. Therefore, it is most efficient to use 1-2 in creation and load the rest after the floorbot is done.

  - name: APC (hack)
    info:
      notes: There are four wires. Two short out the APC when cut, one cuts AI control when cut, and one does nothing when cut, but unlocks the APC when pulsed with a multitool.  There's a chance you'll get shocked when cutting wires, so either have insulated gloves or do it in an isolated area where no-one will find you.  South maintenance is a good choice.
